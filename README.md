# Data-Wrangling-And-Analysis

This was the second project for the Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree

I was tasked with collecting data on a twitter profile; this data was collected from a spreadsheet (csv/tsv), api data collection (json) and programatocally downloaded online. I placed each of them into it's own dataframe using the csv funtion of python. I also created a folder for the programatically collected data. I then proceed to analyze it as detailed in the files within this repository.
