# Data-Wrangling-And-Analysis

This was the second project for the Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree

I was tasked with collecting data on a Twitter profile; this data was collected from a spreadsheet (CSV/TSV), API data collection (JSON) and programmatically downloaded online. I placed each of them into its data frame using the CSV function of Python. I also created a folder for the programmatically collected data. I then analyze it as detailed in the files within this repository.
